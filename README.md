<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
These scrapers are tailored to specific websites and use techniques such as HTML parsing and DOM traversal to efficiently retrieve targeted information. The repository aims to facilitate the development of new web scrapers. Further updates and improvements will follow.

Here's why:
* You shouldn't be built the same components over and over like creating a scraper from scratch all the time
* Your time should be focused on the details of the website that is to be scraped
* You should avoid making mistakes by changing a lot of things that have the same meaning but are in different places

Of course, the code may not be useful to you, as your needs may be different.So I'll be adding more functionality in the near future. You can also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.
